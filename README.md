# Employee Management System API

## Project Description
The Employee Management System API is a robust web service developed using .NET Core and C#. This API serves as a comprehensive tool for managing employee data within an organization. It is designed to provide endpoints for various operations related to employee management.

## Features
1. **Authentication and Authorization:**
    - Implement a secure authentication system with user roles (admin, manager, employee).
    - Only authorized users should have access to certain endpoints.

2. **Employee CRUD Operations:**
    - Allow users to perform CRUD operations on employee records.
    - Capture essential employee details such as name, contact information, role, and department.

3. **Department Management:**
    - Include functionality for managing departments.
    - Assign employees to specific departments.

4. **Salary Management:**
    - Implement a salary management system.
    - Expose endpoints to track salary details, bonuses, and deductions.

5. **Leave Management:**
    - Create a leave management system.
    - Allow employees to apply for leave, and managers to approve or reject requests.

6. **Attendance Tracking:**
    - Implement an attendance tracking feature.
    - Expose endpoints for employees to log their daily attendance, and retrieve attendance reports.

7. **Reporting and Analytics:**
    - Expose endpoints to generate reports on employee details, department-wise distribution, and attendance patterns.
    - Provide insights into salary distribution and leave trends.

8. **Search and Filter Functionality:**
    - Implement search and filter options for endpoints to allow quick data retrieval.
    - Allow users to search for employees based on different criteria.

9. **Data Validation and Error Handling:**
    - Implement robust data validation to ensure data integrity.
    - Handle errors gracefully and provide informative error messages.

10. **Database Connectivity:**
    - Use Entity Framework Core to connect the API to a SQL database.
    - Design an efficient database schema to store employee-related data.

11. **Security Measures:**
    - Implement encryption for sensitive data transmission.
    - Ensure secure handling of user authentication and authorization.
